Acknowledging subMIT
--------------------


It is very helpful for us to have a record of publications that made use
of subMIT resources (be those the physical hardware, or the human support
that we provide).

If possible, please send an e-mail letting us know you've published a
preprint or paper (to submit-help@mit.edu) that made use of our resources.

We would also appreciate it if you could acknowledge subMIT in your
publications, where appropriate, with the following language:

*This work made use of resources provided by subMIT at MIT Physics.*

In addition, you can cite the following preprint::

    @misc{bendavid2025submitphysicsanalysisfacility,
        title={SubMIT: A Physics Analysis Facility at MIT}, 
        author={Josh Bendavid and Mariarosaria D'Alfonso and Jan Eysermans and Chad Freer and Maxim Goncharov and Matthew Heine and Luca Lavezzo and Marianne Moore and Christoph Paus and Xuejian Shen and David Walter and Zhangqier Wang},
        year={2025},
        eprint={2506.01958},
        archivePrefix={arXiv},
        primaryClass={cs.DC},
        url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01958}, 
    }

We will also periodically send around e-mails to the users lists reminding
users to let us know about any recently published papers.
